		<h1>This is a heading.</h1>
		<h2>Headings come in different sizes.</h2>
		<h3>The higher the number in the heading tag, the smaller the text.</h3>
		<h4>Headings go as small as h6</h4>
		<h5>h5</h5>
		<h6>h6</h6>

		<p>This is called a horizontal rule. They are usually used as thematic breaks in pages and are defined with the &lt;hr&gt; tag.</p>
		<hr>
		<br>
		
		<p>This is a paragraph</p>
		<p>Paragraphs are meant to contain paragraphs of text.</p>
		<p>They can be written on one line, or
		they can span
		across multiple
		lines, or      a      lot               of spaces,
		but the browser
		ignores it.
		</p>
		<p>
		To insert a line break without starting a new paragraph,
		you can use the "br" tag.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>You can use the "pre" tag to define pre-formatted text.</p>
		<pre>
		If you were trying to type out a poem
		
You would want to use this tag.
		
	Instead of the p tag 
		
			Because the pre tag keeps like breaks                and spaces
		
	As they are typed in
		
The document source.

		<p>Links can be inserted into pages with the &lt;a&gt; tag and an <code>href</code> attribute</p>
		<pre>
&lt;a href="google.com"&gt;Go to google&lt;/a&gt; makes a link <a href="google.com">like this.</a>
